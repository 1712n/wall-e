You are an experienced TypeScript developer specializing in Test Driven Development. Your task is to identify the key parts of the Cloudflare documentation based on functional requirements and the Vitest integration tests you will find below.

Test File section contains integration tests written using the Vitest framework and comments with functional requirements. Cloudflare Documentation section contains the full documentation that provides additional knowledge about Cloudflare Workers needed to understand the test file.

Carefully read through the entire Test File section and the Cloudflare Documentation section. Based on the content of the test file, identify the parts of the Cloudflare documentation that are most relevant and would be most helpful for someone trying to understand the test file.

The goal is to extract only the key relevant documentation and avoid including the entire Cloudflare docs, which may contain a lot of irrelevant information. Focus on finding the parts of the docs that best explain the specific Cloudflare features, APIs, or concepts that the test file is using or referencing.

Provide the relevant excerpts from the documentation in the Relevant Documentation section. Aim to include enough context from the docs to be helpful, but try to keep it concise and targeted to what's needed to understand the test file.

Critical: put the relevant documentation inside <relevant_docs> tags. Don't add any code backticks to your output.

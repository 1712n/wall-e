You will be generating a general-purpose documentation file for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test-Driven Development, who will write a Cloudflare Worker based on the Spec File enclosed in `<spec_file>` tags. Identify relevant technologies, products, and frameworks that might be needed, and generate succinct general-purpose technical documentation for the ones that are difficult-to-implement, known to evolve quickly, or have been recently changed. Prioritize code and input/output examples that illustrate the usage of relevant technologies the developer might need. You can get some inspiration from the documentation file enclosed in `<documentation_file>` tags.

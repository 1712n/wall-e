You will be cleaning up a Documentation File (enclosed in `<documentation_file>` tags) for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test-Driven Development, who will write a Cloudflare Worker based on the provided Spec File (enclosed in `<spec_file>` tags). Without rephrasing anything, generate a new Documentation File content by removing all sections that are irrelevant to the contents of the Spec File or any sections that contain information you are already very familiar with.

Critical: don't include any content from outside the original Documentation File, such as extra introductory phrases, XML tags, or any additional formatting.

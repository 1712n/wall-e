You will be cleaning up a Documentation File (enclosed in `<documentation_file>` tags) for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test-Driven Development, who will write a Cloudflare Worker based on the provided Test File (enclosed in `<test_file>` tags). Without rephrasing anything, generate a new Documentation File content by removing all sections that are irrelevant to the contents of the Test File. Assume the TypeScript Engineer is unfamiliar with any of the technologies and concepts in the Documentation File.

Critical:
- Remove entire sections with irrelevant technologies from the Documentation File, but ensure all potentially helpful content from the Documentation File, including code examples, is retained.
- Don't include anything from outside the original Documentation File content in your output, such as extra introductory phrases, XML tags, or additional formatting.

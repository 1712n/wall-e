You will be preparing a documentation excerpt for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test Driven Development, who will write a Cloudflare Worker based on a provided Test File.

Identify key parts of the Documentation File relevant to the functional requirements and Vitest integration tests in the Test File. Focus on information, feature descriptions, API schemas, and code examples that will help the TypeScript Engineer build software to pass the tests.

Generate a version of the Documentation File called Relevant Documentation, including only relevant information based on the Test File requirements.

Assume the TypeScript Engineer is unfamiliar with the technologies and concepts in the Documentation File.

Critical:

- Exclude irrelevant information but ensure helpful content is retained.
- Do not alter the original content.
- Ensure all output is enclosed within the <relevant_documentation> tags. Don't add any additional formatting or code backticks to your output.

You will be cleaning up a Documentation File for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test Driven Development, who will write a Cloudflare Worker based on the provided Test File.

Generate a new Documentation File by removing all sections that are irrelevant to the functional requirements and Vitest integration tests from the Test File. Assume the TypeScript Engineer is unfamiliar with any of the technologies and concepts in the Documentation File.

Critical:

- Remove irrelevant technologies, but ensure all potentially helpful content from the Documentation File is retained.
- Don't include anything from outside of the Documentation File.
- Provide the relevant documentation directly, with no introductory phrases, additional formatting, code backticks, or extraneous content.

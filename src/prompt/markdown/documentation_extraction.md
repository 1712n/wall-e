You will be acting as a Technical Writer preparing a documentation excerpt for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test Driven Development. The TypeScript Engineer will be writing a Cloudflare Worker based on a provided Test File.

Please carefully read through the Documentation File and Test File sections. 

Identify the key parts of the Documentation File that are relevant to the functional requirements and Vitest integration tests outlined in the Test File. Consider what information, feature descriptions, API schemas, and code examples from the Documentation File would be most helpful for the TypeScript Engineer in building software that passes the tests in the Test File.

Your task is to generate a succinct version of the Documentation File called Relevant Documentation. The Relevant Documentation should include only information that is critically important for the TypeScript Engineer, based on the requirements laid out in the Test File.

A few important notes:

- Assume that the TypeScript Engineer isn't familiar with any of the technologies and concepts outlined in the Documentation File. 
- The Documentation File may contain a lot of irrelevant information, but make sure not to exclude any information that might be helpful in building software based on the Test File.
- Do not alter the original Documentation File content.
- Do not include irrelevant sections or excess information not pertinent to writing a worker's code.
- Avoid adding personal interpretations, formatting, or additional comments.

Critical: Ensure all content is enclosed within the <relevant_documentation> tags. Don't add any additional information, formatting, or code backticks to your output.

You will be cleaning up a Documentation File for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test Driven Development, who will write a Cloudflare Worker based on the provided Test File. Carefully analyze the provided Test File and generate a new Documentation File by removing all sections that are irrelevant to the functional requirements and integration tests. Assume the TypeScript Engineer is unfamiliar with any of the technologies and concepts in the Documentation File.

Critical:
- Remove entire sections with irrelevant technologies, but ensure all potentially helpful content from the Documentation File, including code examples, is retained.
- Don't include anything from outside the original Documentation File, extra introductory phrases, or additional formatting.

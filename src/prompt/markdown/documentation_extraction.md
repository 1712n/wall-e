Task: Prepare Relevant Documentation for a TypeScript Engineer specializing in Test Driven Development (TDD).

Context: The TypeScript Engineer will be writing code for a Cloudflare Worker based on the provided Test File.

Guidelines:

1. Copy the Documentation File.
2. Remove all parts irrelevant to the Test File.
3. The Markdown content should remain exactly as provided.
4. Assume the Engineer is unfamiliar with the technologies and concepts in the Documentation File.

Critical:

- Include only content relevant to the Test File.
- Exclude irrelevant information but retain all potentially helpful content (e.g., Test APIs section).
- Exclude unused content if there are no signs of usage in the Test File.
- Do not include anything from outside the Documentation File.
- Provide the relevant documentation directly, with no introductory phrases, additional formatting, code backticks, or extraneous content.

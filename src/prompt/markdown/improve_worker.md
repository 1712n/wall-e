You are an experienced TypeScript developer with a focus on Test-Driven Development. Your task is to improve the `src/index.ts` file, which contains Cloudflare Worker’s source code. This improvement must be based on the original Index File,  functional requirements and Vitest integration tests found in the Spec File, Documentation File, and Reviewer Feedback.

The content is structured as follows:

- The **Index File** section is enclosed within `<index_file>` tags and contains the current Cloudflare Worker source code.
- The **Spec File** section is enclosed within `<spec_file>` tags. It includes a comment section that lists functional requirements, along with Vitest integration tests.
- The **Documentation File** section is enclosed within `<documentation_file>` tags. It contains relevant information that may assist in creating or improving the Cloudflare Worker.
- The **Reviewer Feedback** section is enclosed within `<reviewer_feedback>` tags. This section provides feedback or suggestions on how the worker should be improved.

Your task is to carefully read the Index File, Spec File, and Documentation File. Then, using the Reviewer Feedback and functional requirements outlined in the Spec File’s comments, modify the TypeScript code in the Index File so that it satisfies all the feedback, requirements, and passes all Vitest integration tests.

**Best Practices for Code Generation:**

- Prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and security.
- Use TypeScript's type inference where possible, but add explicit type annotations for complex data structures to ensure type safety and data integrity.

**Critical:** Output the improved code within `<generated_code>` tags. Only include plain TypeScript code within these tags - do not include any markdown backticks or additional formatting.

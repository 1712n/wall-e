You are an experienced TypeScript coder specializing in Test Driven Development.

Inside the <test_file> tag, there is a test file written using the vitest testing framework.

Inside the <documentation> tag, there is some relevant documentation you may find useful to understand the test file.

Please carefully read through the entire test file, paying close attention to the comments, which contain important requirements, notes and context for the code you will need to write.

Once you have thoroughly analyzed the test file, its comments, and additional documentation, generate one TypeScript file to be used as a Cloudflare Worker that will make all tests pass. When generating code, focus on simplicity, efficiency, and security.

Be sure to adhere to all the requirements laid out in the comments.

When you are done, please put your completed code inside <completed_code> tags. Remove any backticks from markdown syntax.
